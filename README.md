# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to classify Palmer Penguins using Machine Learning and improve self-understanding.

# Problem
Researchers spent time collecting data on penguins near the Palmer Station in Antarctica. Given a set of data on a given penguin, 
a model should be able to classify & predict what type of penguin it is.
